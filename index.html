          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <h2>ðŸ‘‹ This lovely pupper is Cuddles.</h2>
          <p>
            When I adopted Cuddles, a pitbull, I quickly realized that it was almost impossible to find a dog boarding business that would accept her. Many places had breed restrictions or simply refused to take pitbulls, leaving me with few options when I needed to go on a trip. It was a constant struggle to find someone I trusted to take care of Cuddles while I was away.<br><br>
            I started Pawsitive Stay as a Facebook group with 3 members - myself and two other pet owners who were also struggling to find places for their pets to stay. Our goal was to foster each other's pets when someone had to go away. As word spread, more and more people joined our group. Before we knew it, we had a close-knit community of 150 pet parents who were all willing to open up their homes to each other's pets.<br><br>
            Pawsitive Stay has now graduated from a Facebook group to a not for profit business, with the same mission of connecting loving pet parents with couches and kennels for their furry friends while they are away. And best of all, we will always be a FREE SERVICE, so that everyone can benefit from the loving care and support of our community. If you're tired of the stress and worry of finding a safe and welcoming place for your pet to stay, join the Pawsitive Stay family today and give your pet the love and care they deserve while you're away.

              <!-- faq answer -->
              <div class="faq__body">
                <p>Pawsitive Stay is a platform that connects like-minded individuals who are willing to open their homes to each other's pets and provide a safe and welcoming environment for them. 
                  <br>Unlike traditional pet boarding services, Pawsitive Stay is free. 
                  <br>Once you become a member, you can offer a couch, spare room, or kennel to other pets in need. When you need to go away, you can search for available accommodations within the Pawsitive Stay community and choose the one that best fits your needs.
                  <br>All members of the Pawsitive Stay community are pet owners themselves, so they understand the importance of caring for someone else's pet as if it were their own.

              <!-- faq answer -->
              <div class="faq__body">
                <p>Pawsitive Stay uses a unique currency called "Pawpsicles" (or "Pawps" for short) to facilitate payments between members for pet-sitting services. 
                  <br> For every hour of service that you provide to another member, you will be awarded 1 Pawp. When you join the Pawsitive Stay community, you will be awarded 8 Pawps as a starting balance.
                  <br>Your account can accrue a negative balance up to 48 Pawps in case of emergencies. However, if your account remains in negative balance for 3 months, you will receive a warning. If the account is still in negative balance after one month, it will be terminated.
                  <br>This system is designed to encourage a balance of consumers and producers within the Pawsitive Stay community and ensure that everyone is contributing to the community in some way. While the platform is free to join and use, the barter market helps to create a sense of mutual support and accountability among members.
