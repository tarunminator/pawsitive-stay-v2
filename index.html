          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <h2>ðŸ‘‹ This lovely pupper is Cuddles.</h2>
          <p>
            When I adopted Cuddles, a pitbull, I quickly realized that it was almost impossible to find a dog boarding business that would accept her. Many places had breed restrictions or simply refused to take pitbulls, leaving me with few options when I needed to go on a trip. It was a constant struggle to find someone I trusted to take care of Cuddles while I was away.<br><br>
            I started Pawsitive Stay as a Facebook group with 3 members - myself and two other pet owners who were also struggling to find places for their pets to stay. Our goal was to foster each other's pets when someone had to go away. As word spread, more and more people joined our group. Before we knew it, we had a close-knit community of 150 pet parents who were all willing to open up their homes to each other's pets.<br><br>
            Pawsitive Stay has now graduated from a Facebook group to a not for profit business, with the same mission of connecting loving pet parents with couches and kennels for their furry friends while they are away. And best of all, we will always be a FREE SERVICE, so that everyone can benefit from the loving care and support of our community. If you're tired of the stress and worry of finding a safe and welcoming place for your pet to stay, join the Pawsitive Stay family today and give your pet the love and care they deserve while you're away.
